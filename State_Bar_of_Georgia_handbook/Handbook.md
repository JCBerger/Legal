Rule 1-208. Resignation from Membership

Resignation while in good standing. A member of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing may, under oath, petition the Executive Committee for leave to resign from the State Bar of Georgia. Upon acceptance of such petition by the Executive Committee by majority vote, such person shall not practice law in this state nor be entitled to any privileges and benefits accorded to active members of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing unless such person complies with part (f) or part (g) of this Rule.
Resignation while delinquent or suspended for failure to pay dues or for failure to comply with continuing legal education requirements. A member of the State Bar of Georgia who is delinquent or suspended (but not terminated) for failure to pay dues or failure to comply with continuing legal education requirements may, under oath, petition the Executive Committee for leave to resign from the State Bar of Georgia.

No petition for leave to resign shall be accepted if there are disciplinary proceedings or criminal charges pending against the member, or if the member is not in good standing for failure to pay child support obligations under Bar Rule 1-209. A petition filed under this Rule shall constitute a waiver of the confidentiality provisions of Rule 4-221 (d) as to any pending disciplinary proceedings.

If the penalty imposed on the resigned member is disbarment or suspension, the status of the member shall be changed from “resigned member” to that of a person so disciplined.
A petition filed under this Rule shall not toll the provisions of Rule 1-501 (c).

Readmission after five years. After the expiration of five years from the effective date of a voluntary resignation, the former member must comply with the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law in Georgia as adopted by the Supreme Court of Georgia.

A Bar member shall not willfully refuse, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction under the procedures of O.G.C.A. § 19-6-28.1, to timely pay a child support obligation and continue such refusal for thirty days after said determination becomes final. A certified copy of a court order finding that the member has willfully failed to maintain compliance with child support obligations shall be conclusive evidence of an infraction of this Rule. So long as a member is complying fully with the purge provisions of a court order of contempt for non-payment of child support, this Rule shall not apply.
Not in Good Standing Upon Non Compliance. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction makes a finding, under the procedures of O.G.C.A. § 19-6-28.1, that a member has willfully failed to timely pay a child support obligation and continues such refusal for thirty days after said determination becomes final, the member shall be deemed not to be in good standing and shall remain in such status until such time as the noncompliance is corrected.
Action by State Bar of Georgia. Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order by a court of competent jurisdiction, under the procedures of O.G.C.A. § 19-6-28.1, finding that a member has failed to timely pay a child support obligation and continues such refusal for thirty days after said determination becomes final, a notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the member's current address contained in the membership records of the State Bar. The notice is deemed received whenever actually received or five days after the notice is mailed, whichever is sooner.
Return to Good Standing. A member deemed not to be in good standing under this Rule shall be deemed to be in good standing upon providing the Executive Director of the State Bar a certified copy of a court order finding that the delinquency has been satisfied and by paying an administrative fee set by the Executive Committee. The member shall be returned to good standing only upon compliance with the foregoing conditions. 
CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF GOVERNORS
Rule 1-301. Government by the Board of Governors

The President, the President-elect, the Immediate Past President, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the President of the Young Lawyers Division, the President-elect of the Young Lawyers Division, the Immediate Past President of the Young Lawyers Division and the Attorney General of Georgia;
 
the number of Board of Governors members for each Judicial Circuit as existed on January 1, 2001, plus an additional 7 Board of Governor members to be elected from the Atlanta Circuit.

The size of the Board of Governors, excluding those designated in subsection (a)(1) above, shall not exceed 150, except as set out in subsection (b) below.
 
If the geographical limits of a judicial circuit are changed, and by reason of said change there is a reduction in the number of Superior Court judges to which that circuit was entitled on July 1, 1979, then and in that event, there shall be a corresponding reduction in the number of members of the Board of Governors representing that circuit provided there was more than one Board member representing that circuit. In the event that there is such a reduction, the last created post will be the first post eliminated.
 
If the change in the geographical limits of a judicial circuit does not result in a reduction in the number of Superior Court judges in such circuit, then such circuit shall retain at least as many members of the Board of Governors as it had on July 1, 1979. Additional Board representation will be determined by the number of active members of the State Bar residing in that circuit as provided above. A change in the name of a judicial circuit shall have no effect upon that circuit's Board of Governors' representatives, except as otherwise provided.
 
two representatives of the active members of the State Bar of Georgia residing outside of the State of Georgia, who themselves must be residents of different states of the United States. The nonresident representative shall be an active member of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing residing outside of the State of Georgia.
 
three members appointed as follows: The President-elect in office when this rule becomes effective shall appoint three members to the Board of Governors. Thereafter, the President-elect shall appoint the number of such members whose term expired at the annual meeting at which the President-elect assumed office. The appointed members shall be chosen in such a manner as to promote diversity within the Board of Governors.
 
Upon the creation of a new circuit, such circuit shall be entitled to elect one member to the Board of Governors even if the cap of 150 Board of Governors members has been reached, and if the cap has not been reached, may be entitled to elect additional members depending on the number of active members of the State of Georgia residing in the circuit as provided above.
 
A member of the Board of Governors must be an active member of the State Bar of Georgia in good standing. A member representing a judicial circuit shall be a member of the bar of that circuit.

The State Bar of Georgia shall, in its bylaws, establish the term of office and the method of election of the members of the Board of Governors representing judicial circuits and nonresident members. Such method of election shall ensure that:

the election will be by secret written or secure electronic ballot;
each active member of the State Bar of Georgia, in conjunction with a specified number of other active members, will have the right, upon compliance with reasonable conditions, to nominate a candidate from his judicial circuit (or candidates in circuits electing more than one member of the Board of Governors in such election) whose name will be placed on the ballot for his circuit;
each active member of the State Bar of Georgia residing outside of the State, in conjunction with a specified number of other active nonresident members, will have the right, upon compliance with reasonable conditions, to nominate a candidate from the active members of the State Bar of Georgia residing outside of the State.

a ballot for his judicial circuit will be mailed to each active resident member and a ballot will be mailed to each active nonresident member in the case of election of nonresident board member, having printed thereon the names of all qualified nominees for such circuit or nonresident post and space for a write-in vote in ample time for the member to cast the ballot before the time fixed for the election. In lieu of a written ballot, a secure electronic ballot, which meets the requirements above, may be provided to members;
each nominee shall be entitled to have at least one observer present at the counting of the ballots from his judicial circuit; and
any change in the geographical limits of a judicial circuit or circuits shall automatically terminate the terms of all members elected to the Board of Governors, accordingly in such manners as the bylaws may provide. In the event the geographical limits of a circuit are changed after the notices of election have been distributed to the members of the State Bar of Georgia, then and in that event, the terms of the members of the Board of Governors from such circuits will remain as they were before the change in geographical limits until the election of the Board of Governors to be held the following year.
Rule 1-305. Change in Geographical limits of Judicial Circuits

Notice of time and place of the hearing shall be mailed at least ten days in advance. The party cited may be represented by counsel. Witnesses shall be sworn; and, if requested by the party cited, a complete electronic record or a transcript shall be made of all proceedings and testimony.

The party cited may not be required to testify over his or her objection.

The Executive Committee shall (1) make findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall determine whether the party cited was delinquent in violation of  Rule 1-501; and (2) upon a finding of delinquency shall determine whether there was reasonable cause for the delinquency. Financial hardship short of adjudicated bankruptcy shall not constitute reasonable cause. A copy of the findings and the determination shall be sent to the party cited. If it is determined that no delinquency has occurred, the matter shall be dismissed. If it is determined that delinquency has occurred but that there was reasonable cause therefor, the matter shall be deferred for one year at which time the matter will be reconsidered.

An appropriate notice of suspension shall be sent to the clerks of all Georgia courts and shall be published in an official publication of the State Bar of Georgia.

After a finding of delinquency, a copy of the finding shall be served upon the respondent attorney. The respondent attorney may file with the Court any written exceptions (supported by the written argument) said respondent may have to the findings of the Executive Committee. All such exceptions shall be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Georgia and served on the Executive Committee by service on the General Counsel within 20 days of the date that the findings were served on the respondent attorney. Upon the filing of exceptions by the respondent attorney, the Executive Committee shall within 20 days of said filing file a report of its findings and the complete record and transcript of evidence with the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Supreme Court of Georgia may grant extensions of time for filing in appropriate cases. Findings of fact by the Executive Committee shall be conclusive if supported by any evidence. The Supreme Court of Georgia may grant oral argument on any exception filed with it upon application for such argument by the respondent attorney or the Executive Committee. The Supreme Court of Georgia shall promptly consider the report of the Executive Committee, exceptions thereto, and the responses filed by any party to such exceptions, if any, and enter its judgment. A copy of the Supreme Court of Georgia's judgment shall be transmitted to the Executive Committee and to the respondent attorney by the Supreme Court of Georgia.

Within 30 days after a final judgment which suspends membership, the suspended member shall, under the supervision of the Supreme Court of Georgia, notify all clients of said suspended member's inability to represent them and of the necessity for promptly retaining new counsel, and shall take all actions necessary to protect the interests of said suspended member's clients. Should the suspended member fail to notify said clients or fail to protect their interests as herein required, the Supreme Court of Georgia, upon its motion, or upon the motion of the State Bar of Georgia, and after ten days notice to the suspended member and proof of failure to notify or protect said clients, may hold the suspended member in contempt and order that a member or members of the State Bar of Georgia take charge of the files and records of said suspended member and proceed to notify all clients and take such steps as seem indicated to protect their interests. Any member of the State Bar of Georgia appointed by the Supreme Court of Georgia to take charge of the files and records of the suspended member under these Rules shall not be permitted to disclose any information contained in the files and records in his or her care without the consent of the client to whom such file or record relates, except as clearly necessary to carry out the order of the Supreme Court of Georgia.

The newly created post(s) shall be inserted in the appropriate column in Section 5 above. If a circuit is abolished, the name of the circuit and all post(s) therein shall be stricken from the appropriate column(s) in Section 5 above. Upon the creation of a new judicial circuit, such circuit shall be entitled to at least one membership on the Board even if the cap of 150 members set out in Section 2(d) above has been reached, and if the cap has not been reached, may be entitled to additional members depending on the number of active members of the State Bar residing in the circuit, according to the formula set forth in Section 2 of this Article. Likewise, the terms of office and method of designating "odd" or "even" posts shall be in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this Article.

If the geographical limits of a judicial circuit are changed, and by reason of said change there is a reduction in the number of Superior Court judges to which that circuit was entitled to on July 1, 1979, there shall be a corresponding reduction in the number of members of the Board representing that circuit if there were more than one Board member representing that circuit. In the event of a reduction, the last-created post will be the first post eliminated. If the change in the geographical limits of a judicial circuit does not result in a reduction in the number of Superior Court judges in such circuit, then such circuit shall retain at least as many members of the Board as it had on July 1, 1979. The terms of office of said members of the Board shall remain as they were prior to the change in the geographical limits of the circuit.

Additional members of the circuit which has experienced a change in geographical limits, if the cap has not been reached, will be determined by the number of active members of the State Bar residing in that circuit as provided in Section 2 of this Article.
A change in the name of a judicial circuit shall have no effect upon the circuit's Board's representatives, except as otherwise provided.
When the geographical limits of circuits are altered, the term(s) of the member(s) from the new circuit with the same name as the former circuit shall be the same as the term(s) of the member(s) from the former circuit. The term of the first member from the new circuit with a new name shall be determined by adding the name of that circuit to the column in Section 5 above containing the least number of positions.
If two or more of the events referred to in this Section occur in the same year, the terms of members affected shall be determined by performing the steps in subparagraphs (a) and (b) in that order, and as between two or more alterations of geographical limits, in the order of their effective dates or if they have the same effective date, in order of the introduction of the legislation making the alteration.
For the purposes of this Section, legislation shall be deemed effective on the date of its enactment and elections shall be held accordingly, notwithstanding that by its terms the legislation is not effective until a later date. However, a person elected to a position on the Board of Governors as a result of legislation shall not become a member until the actual effective date of the legislation.
Whenever, under subparagraphs (a) and (b) hereof, it is directed that a circuit or post be added or stricken from the columns in Section 5 above, the section is automatically amended accordingly.
Section 7. Honorary Members.

All past Presidents of the Georgia Bar Association, all past Presidents of the State Bar, except the Immediate Past President, and all past Presidents of the Younger Lawyers Section of the State Bar shall be honorary members of the Board of Governors, provided they are members of the State Bar. Honorary members may attend all meetings of the Board and participate in its proceedings, but shall not vote on any question arising in the meetings of the Board, nor be counted in ascertaining a quorum.

Section 8. New Positions, Unfilled Positions, Vacancies, and Lost Positions.

If any new position is created in a circuit because of an increase in membership of such circuit, or if any new position is created as a result of legislation establishing a new judicial circuit, the President shall appoint an active member of the State Bar in such circuit to hold office for the remaining term.
If no successor is elected as provided for in Section 3 of this Article III, the President shall, at the annual meeting or within thirty days thereafter, appoint a successor to the Board from the circuit so failing to elect, or in the case of a nonresident member, from the active nonresident members of the State Bar.
If any other vacancy on the Board of Governors occurs at or between annual meetings of the State Bar, the President shall appoint an active member of the circuit in which the vacancy occurs to hold office for the unexpired term.
In the event a position is eliminated for any reason under this Article III, the representative filling the post to be eliminated shall serve for the remainder of the term for which said representative was elected.
If as a result of a change in the geographical boundaries of any judicial circuit a board member is no longer located within the geographic boundaries of the post to which the member was elected, the president shall appoint such representative to the circuit in which the member is actually located if a vacancy is created or exists in such circuit. If no vacancy exists in the circuit, the board member shall serve out the remainder of his or her term as described in subsection (d) above.
Section 9. Quorum.

LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND PROCEDURE
ADOPTED BY BOARD OF GOVERNORS JUNE 14, 1986,
AMENDED JUNE 20, 1992, JUNE 18, 1994

1.01. General Legislative Policy.

The Bylaws set forth the restrictions on establishing a legislative policy. Article II, Section 6 of the Bylaws provides that:

No legislation shall be recommended, supported or opposed by the State Bar unless:
such action has been initiated by an appropriate committee or section, or by any ten members of the Board of Governors; and
the text of the legislation is furnished to the President, the President-elect and the Advisory Committee on Legislation at least thirty days prior to its submission for support or opposition as set forth below; and
provided further:
that such legislative position receives a majority vote of the members of the State Bar present at a meeting; or
that such legislative position receives a two-thirds vote of the members of the Board of Governors present and voting; or
when the Board of Governors is not in session, such legislative position receives a two-thirds vote of the members of the Executive Committee voting.
In addition to and in aid of these legislative powers, the Board shall have the power to adopt, by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the Board present and voting, a Standing Board Policy regarding legislation. Such Standing Board Policy shall be binding from session to session unless suspended, modified or rescinded pursuant to a two-thirds vote of the members of the Board present and voting.

No committee or section of the State Bar shall recommend, support or oppose any legislation except in the manner herein provided.
No legislative position shall be taken by the State Bar or any committee, section or other organizational element thereof except as provided for in this policy. Committees, sections or other organizational elements of the Bar are encouraged to debate and discuss legislation relating to their areas of expertise and to let the Advisory Committee on Legislation know of their positions. The ultimate position of the State Bar, however, will be determined pursuant to this Policy.
A legislative position, once adopted, shall remain an official position of the State Bar during the full biennial session of the General Assembly in which it was adopted unless rescinded or modified.
Failure to receive a necessary two thirds vote to favor or oppose legislation shall not be considered adoption of the contrary position.
All legislative positions adopted by the State Bar shall be reduced to writing and communicated to the General Assembly as the organizational positions of the State Bar.
The Advisory Committee on Legislation, the Board, or the Executive Committee may allow any interested person to appear before it in person and in writing in support of or in opposition to any legislative proposal being considered subject to reasonable limitations on available time.
The Board and Executive Committee shall have authority to take reasonable action necessary to communicate and advocate legislative positions adopted pursuant to the Bylaws and this policy.
The Board or the Executive Committee shall have the authority to designate persons to promote State Bar legislative positions. Persons so designated shall be authorized to agree to and to support amendments and substitute legislation which are consistent with legislative positions previously adopted pursuant to the Bylaws and this Policy. No section, committee or other Bar-related organization shall hire or designate any persons or entities to promote State Bar or their own legislative positions nor shall such sections, committees or Bar-related organization expend any funds of the section, committee or organization in the support of or opposition to any legislative positions unless expressly approved by the Board of Governors or the Executive Committee. Should the Board of Governors or the Executive Committee approve such expenditures, the funds of the section, committee or Bar-related organization shall be paid into the Legislative Advocacy Fund.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to prevent members of the State Bar from presenting their own personal views concerning any legislative matter and members are encouraged to do so while making clear that they are speaking only in their personal capacity.
1.02. Board of Governors.

Consideration of any legislative proposal by the Board shall proceed in the following order:
A written proposal shall be presented by an appropriate committee or section or by any 10 members of the Board to the Advisory Committee on Legislation, the President, the President-elect, and each member of the Executive Committee at least 30 days prior to a meeting of the Board. Such proposal shall, as a minimum, include the following:
the specific legislation, if any, which is pending or proposed;
if no specific legislation is pending or proposed, a statement of the issues to be addressed by the legislation;
a summary of the existing law;
principal known proponents or opponents of the legislation and, if possible, a brief statement of the reasons for opposition or support by the other interests;
a listing of any other committees or sections which may have an interest in the legislation and a certification that any such committees have been provided a copy of the proposal simultaneous to its transmission to the Advisory Committee on Legislation; and
the position which the committee, section or group recommends be adopted by the State Bar.
The Advisory Committee on Legislation, after consideration of the legislative proposal in accordance with Rule 1.04 of this policy, shall make a written recommendation concerning the proposal to the Board at its next meeting. A copy of the written recommendation shall be furnished to each member of the Executive Committee at least ten (10) days prior to the Board meeting.
The Board shall determine specifically by a majority vote of members present and voting whether the proposed legislative action is germane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar.
If the determination in section (3) above is affirmative, then at least two thirds of the members of the Board present and voting must vote to recommend, to support, or to oppose the legislative proposal.
Legislative positions may be considered and adopted by the Board at any special or regular meeting.
1.03. Executive Committee.

Consideration of any legislative proposal by the Executive Committee shall proceed in the following order:
a proposal adopted by the Advisory Committee on Legislation or from a member of the Executive Committee shall be presented;
the Executive Committee shall specifically determine by a majority of members voting whether the proposed legislative action is germane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar;
if the determination in subsection (2) above is affirmative, then the Executive Committee shall then determine by a majority vote of those voting either that (i) the requested legislative action could not reasonably have been submitted for consideration by the Board of Governors in accordance with existing policies, or: (ii) that a significant material change in circumstances since the last Board of Governors has made the Executive Committee action necessary;
if either determination in subsection (3) above is affirmative, at least two thirds of the members of the Executive Committee voting must vote to recommend, to support, or to oppose the legislative proposal.
The Executive Committee shall take no action inconsistent with previous action of the Board on substantially identical legislation unless there has been a significant material change in circumstances since the last meeting of the Board of Governors. The failure to receive the required two thirds vote of the Board of Governors shall not be considered "previous action" by the Board.
If any emergency exists and is not feasible for the Executive Committee to act, then the president, upon consultation with and agreement by any two from among the president-elect, the immediate past president and the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Legislation may act upon pending or proposed legislation.
Any action taken by the Executive Committee or president shall be reported to the Board at its next meeting.
1.04. Advisory Committee on Legislation.

The President, upon consultation with and agreement by the President-elect shall have the power to appoint additional voting members to the Advisory Committee who shall serve during the one-year term of his presidency. However, in any event at least two-thirds of this Committee will be members of the Board at the time of their appointment.
The Advisory Committee will meet for the purpose of developing its recommendations to the Board and Executive Committee with regard to requests to adopt a legislative position.
In each case involving a proposed legislative position, the Advisory Committee shall make a recommendation to the Board or the Executive Committee on the following:
whether the proposed legislative action is germane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar; and
the legislative position which the Board or Executive Committee should adopt.
In addition to the above, the Advisory Committee shall also have the authority to draft and submit to the Board or the Executive Committee, legislative concepts which may or should be the subject of legislation and recommend positions with respect thereto.
When the General Assembly is in session, appropriate committees and sections of the State Bar may submit legislative proposals to the Advisory Committee for approval by the Executive Committee. All such proposals, however, shall be in writing and satisfy the format requirements set forth in subsection (a)(1) of Rule 1.02 of this policy.
The Advisory Committee shall review all legislation filed in the State Legislature which would require an amendment to the State Constitution. The Advisory Committee shall determine whether the State Bar should take a position pursuant to this policy regarding the proposed constitutional amendment.

1.05. Legislative Drafting and Consulting Services.

The State Bar, at the sole discretion of the Executive Committee, may provide legislative drafting, legal research and other similar services to the Office of the Governor and members of the Georgia General Assembly. THE DECISION BY THE STATE BAR TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT BY THE STATE BAR OF ANY LEGISLATION REVIEWED OR DRAFTED.
All requests for legislative drafting or consulting services should be directed to the President of the State Bar who shall immediately place the request on the agenda of the next Executive Committee Meeting.
Consideration of any legislative drafting or consulting request by the Executive Committee shall proceed in the following order:
the president shall present the request for legislative drafting or consulting services to the Executive Committee;
the Executive Committee shall specifically determine by a majority of members voting that the drafting, research or review of the proposed legislation would not be adverse to the interests of the State Bar;
if the determination in subsection (ii) above is affirmative, then the Executive Committee shall determine by majority vote whether or not to provide such services;
if the determination in subsection (iii) above is affirmative, the Executive Committee shall refer the matter to the Legislative Research Committee, or other appropriate State Bar committee or section.
Should any emergency exist and it is not feasible for the Executive Committee to act, then the President, upon consultation with and agreement by any two from among the President-elect, the immediate past President, the Chair of the Advisory Committee on Legislation or the Chair of the Legislative Research Committee, may act upon the pending request for legislative drafting or consulting services.
The final copy of any proposed legislation drafted by any member or members of the State Bar under this provision shall contain the following disclaimer at the head of the first page, unless the proposed legislation has been considered under the provisions of section 1.01 through 1.04 above: "The State Bar of Georgia has drafted the following proposed legislation as a service to the Georgia General Assembly and the Office of the Governor. The State Bar takes no position either for or against the enactment of such legislation unless the legislation is approved under the provisions of the State Bar of Georgia's Standing Board Policy 100."
Whenever the Executive Committee grants a request to provide legislative drafting or consulting services under this rule, the President, or his or her designee, shall report to the next meeting of the Board of Governors the nature of the referral and current status.
Standing Board Policy 200 (Annual Statement of Revenue and Expenditures)
Publication of Expenditures. The Bar shall publish at least annually a statement of its revenues and expenditures by category. The purpose of this publication shall be to allow the membership to make a determination as to the nature of the expenditures or categories.
Objections. Any active or inactive member of the State Bar of Georgia may, within forty-five (45) days of the date of said publication, file with the Executive Director a written objection to a particular expenditure on the grounds that it is nongermane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar of Georgia. The objection need not state its grounds. Failure to object within this time period shall constitute a waiver of any right to object to the particular expenditure.
After a written objection has been received, the Executive Director shall determine the pro rata amount of the objecting member's mandatory dues at issue, and such amount shall be placed in escrow pending determination of the merits of the objection.
The Executive Committee shall, within sixty (60) days from the last day for receipt of written objections, determine whether to give a pro rata refund to the objecting member(s) or to refer the action(s) to arbitration.
Composition of Arbitration Panel. If the matter is referred to arbitration, it shall be considered by a panel of arbitrators. The arbitration panel shall be composed of three (3) active members of the State Bar of Georgia. The objecting member(s) shall select one member of the arbitration panel, the Bar shall choose the second panel member, and the two members shall choose the third member. The objecting party and the State Bar of Georgia shall select their arbitrators within fifteen (15) days of the date on which the matter is referred to arbitration, and the third arbitrator shall be chosen by the two selected within thirty (30) days of said referral. In the event the two members are unable to agree, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia shall appoint the third member.
Procedures for Arbitration Panel. Within thirty (30) days after the arbitration panel is constituted, the objecting member shall file with the General Counsel of the State Bar of Georgia a supplemental written objection stating in complete detail the grounds of the objection. The State Bar of Georgia shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the supplemental objection, prepare a written response and serve a copy on the objecting member(s). Such response, objection, and supplemental objection shall be forwarded to the arbitration panel. The panel shall schedule a hearing at the headquarters of the State Bar of Georgia within forty-five (45) days of the date on which the objection, supplemental objection, and response are forwarded to the panel. At said hearing, the objecting member and the Bar may appear in person or be represented by counsel. The arbitration panel shall thereafter confer and decide by majority vote whether the particular expenditure is nongermane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar of Georgia.
The scope of the arbitration review shall be to determine solely whether the expenditure at issue is constitutionally appropriate for funding from mandatory dues and whether the pro rata amount was correctly computed.
The proceeding of arbitration shall be informal in nature and shall not be bound by the rules of evidence. Any briefs filed by either party shall be limited to fifteen (15) pages. Oral argument shall be limited to twenty (20) minutes per side. The decision of the arbitrators shall be binding as to the objecting member(s) and the State Bar of Georgia. If the arbitrators conclude that the expenditure at issue is appropriately funded by mandatory dues, there shall be no refund, and the State Bar of Georgia shall be free to expend the objecting member's pro rata amount of mandatory dues held in escrow. If the arbitrators determine that the expenditure is inappropriately funded from mandatory dues, the arbitrators shall order a refund of the pro rata amount of mandatory dues to the objecting member.
The arbitrators shall render a final written report to the objecting member and the Executive Committee within fifteen (15) days of the conclusion of the hearing.
In the event the arbitrators order a refund, the State Bar of Georgia shall provide such refund within thirty (30) days of the date of the arbitration report, together with interest calculated at the judgment rate provided by law, from the date on which the objecting member(s) mandatory dues payment was received.

A written request to the Secretary for an excused absence shall be made within thirty (30) days prior to or after the missed meeting. Should an elected Board member fail to meet the attendance requirement, the position shall become vacant, and the president of the State Bar shall fill the unexpired term by appointment.

It shall be the policy of the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Georgia that any members of the Board who has served a minimum of ten years shall, upon retirement from the Board, be invited to attend all regularly called meetings of the Board of Governors; provided, such member remains in good standing with the State Bar.

Nothing in this policy shall prohibit the State Bar of Georgia from taking disciplinary or other employment action on grounds independent of the acts for which retaliation is forbidden. 
Standing Executive Committee Policy 100 (Amicus Brief Policy)
Amicus Brief Policy (Adopted Feb. 17, 1994)

No Amicus brief shall be authorized by the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Georgia except as provided by this policy, unless the filing of an Amicus brief is requested or ordered by the Georgia Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of Georgia or any federal appellate court.

The request for an Amicus brief shall be accompanied by 15 copies of the proposed brief, a list of all those individuals and groups within the Bar who support the issuance of the brief, and a list of all those individuals and groups within the Bar who oppose the issuance of the brief.
All parties to the litigation shall be given notice of the request to file an Amicus brief and an opportunity to be heard as to their position on the granting or denying of the request.
The Board of Governors shall specifically determine by a majority vote of members present and voting that the subject matter of the proposed Amicus brief is germane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar of Georgia.
If the determination in section (c) above is affirmative, then at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Governors present and voting must vote to approve the filing of the proposed Amicus brief.
The Executive Committee may, by a two-thirds vote of the Committee present and voting, determine that the requested filing of an Amicus brief could not reasonably have been submitted for consideration by the Board of Governors.
If the determination in section (e) above is affirmative, then the Executive Committee must determine by a two-thirds vote of the Committee present and voting that the subject matter of the proposed Amicus brief is germane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar of Georgia.
If the determination in sections (c) and (f) are in the affirmative the Executive Committee must determine by a two-thirds vote of the Committee present and voting that the proposed Amicus brief should be filed.
In determining whether to file an Amicus brief the Executive Committee should, among other considerations, determine that:
the outcome of the litigation will effect persons other than the litigants, and;
the outcome of the litigation will be of general interest to the members of the State Bar of Georgia.
Standing Executive Committee Policy 200 (Use of State Bar Letterhead)
State Bar Letterhead Policy (Adopted Feb. 21, 2002)

Officers, Governors, Members and Employees of the State Bar of Georgia may not use stationery and envelopes bearing the letterhead of the State Bar when nominating, endorsing, or commenting on a candidate in any State Bar election. Candidates in any State Bar election shall ensure that no campaign materials state or imply that such campaign materials are being sent or supplied by the State Bar.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 300 (Board At-Large Appointments)
Appointed Members to the Board of Governors (Adopted Aug. 22, 2003)

Article III, Section 2, Subsection (d) of the Bylaws of the State Bar provides that the President-elect shall appoint one or two members, depending upon the year, to the Board of Governors. The express purpose of this Section is to promote diversity within the Board of Governors. The Executive Committee believes this goal can be best attained by encouraging those who have been appointed to run for election upon the expiration of their appointment and to allow new minority members to be appointed to the Board under this Rule. The Committee therefore adopts this Policy 300.                     

When an appointed member of the Board of Governors has served a full term in office as a result of such appointment, the Executive Committee should encourage such member to seek an elective position on the Board of Governors.
The Executive Committee strongly encourages the President-elect not to reappoint to the Board of Governors under this Rule a person who has already served a full two-year term on the Board of Governors.
The President-elect should expressly inform the person or persons he or she selects under this Rule that they will only serve a single term in the appointed position.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 400 (Appointments to Bench and Bar Cmte.)
Appointments to the Bench and Bar Committee (Adopted August 22, 2003) 

The members of the Bench and Bar Committee of the State Bar of Georgia shall be appointed as follows:

The President of the State Bar of Georgia shall appoint all of the attorney members of the Committee, one Co-Chairperson to the Committee and one Co-Vice Chairperson to the Committee;
The Chairperson of the Council of Superior Court Judges shall appoint all of the judicial members of the Committee, one Co-Chairperson and one Co-Vice Chairperson on the Committee;
To the extent possible, the number of members appointed by the President of the State Bar and the Chairperson of the Council of Superior Court Judges should be the same.
The following organizations may appoint one liaison member to the Committee:
the Supreme Court of Georgia;
the Court of Appeals of Georgia;
the Council of Superior Court Judges;
the Council of State Court Judges;
the Council of Juvenile Court Judges;
the Council of Probate Court Judges;
the Council of Magistrate Court Judges;
the Council of Municipal Court Judges.
The President of the State Bar shall appoint any Executive Committee Liaison, Staff Liaison and any Advisors to the Committee.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 500 (Fax and E-mail Policy)
Faxes and E-mails To Members (Adopted August 22, 2003)

Purpose

It is important for the members of the Bar to be informed about matters relating to the judicial system and legal profession. To that end, the State Bar should provide efficient and effective communication with Georgia lawyers. At the same time, it is recognized that unnecessary or unwanted communications, especially blast faxes and e-mails, have a long-term adverse impact on effective communication. Therefore, this policy is designed to enhance communication by authorizing the use of faxes and e-mails for important information with appropriate limits on frequency and content. It is also intended to maintain compliance with Federal and state laws governing blast faxes and e-mails.

Authorized Communications

All Blast faxes are prohibited.
E-mails are authorized as limited by this policy.
All communications shall be for the lawful purpose of the State Bar of Georgia.
Authorized Users

Supreme Court of Georgia, for any communication to all members;
Court of Appeals of Georgia, for any communication to all members;
State Bar President, for limited, significant Bar related matters to all members;
YLD President, for limited, significant YLD related matters to YLD members;
Board of Governors members, for communications with their Circuit's members;

(In circuits which have two or more representatives on the Board, each communication shall reflect the view of the majority of the representatives. The intent is for a limited number of e-mails from the circuit's representatives as a group rather than multiple e-mails from individual Board members. If the members of a circuit are evenly divided with no majority viewpoint, no e-mail should be sent. The Board members in each circuit may accomplish this by jointly prepared e-mails, by electing a single spokesperson for the group, or by any other method of their choice that accomplishes the intent of this policy.)
State Bar Sections and Committees, for communications from Section leaders with their Section members, but not for soliciting new members; and Committee chairs with their committee members;
Candidates for State Bar elected positions, for Officers of the State Bar or YLD, Executive Committee members, and ABA delegates (limited to contested races and no more than two (2) e-mails per election);
State Bar committees and State Bar staff, for approved communications related to Bar elections;
Administrative Office of the Courts, for use by individual courts to communicate with the lawyers practicing in the courts; and
Others, as approved by the Executive Committee for limited, urgent uses.
All Users Must

Not sell, give or otherwise redistribute the e-mail addresses of the members;
Use format that eliminates downloading of data;
Use only for officially authorized Bar or judicial purpose;
Not be used for private, commercial purposes; and
Allow recipients to be removed from list.
Standards

The subject line will include enough information so recipients can quickly determine if they want to delete the message without opening it. One subject per message is preferred.
The message will be brief, sometimes including instructions on where to get additional information. When applicable, web links may be included.
Attachments in the form of links to PDFs may or may not be included, depending on their number and size.
Each e-mail message will include unsubscribe or opt out instructions. If a member opts out of receiving e-mail messages, all e-mail communications from all entities, including the State Bar, will stop. There may not be a way to selectively opt out receiving e-mails from any particular entity. This is especially important and should be noted in the opt out instructions.
Process

With the exception of State Bar election e-mails, broadcast e-mail messages are coordinated centrally by the Communications Department and are not to be sent by individuals, departments or entities. Because most e-mails are time sensitive, all participants in this process shall cooperate to perform their duties in a timely manner.
With the exception of State Bar election e-mails, the entity wishing to send an e-mail message drafts the message and submits it to the Chief Operating Officer for approval. The President and Executive Director are available for discussion when deemed appropriate by the Chief Operating Officer.
The Chief Operating Officer-approved e-mail message is sent to the Communications Director and to Bar Counsel. After reviewing the e-mail for compliance with law and State Bar rules/policies, Bar Counsel will advise the Communications Director of its findings.
With the exception of State Bar election e-mails, the finalized e-mail message and all related information are sent to the Communications Department for distribution to the list.
The Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer are copied on all fax and e-mail messages. The person(s) initiating the e-mail request is also copied.
All e-mails related to State Bar elections are processed and approved by the Membership Department in accordance with the direction of the Elections Committee.
Note:  Due to anti-spam measures and other e-mail filtering software utilized by our membership, Internet Service Providers (ISP's), and the various data communications equipment which provides the routing of all equipment internet-related traffic, the State Bar cannot guarantee that every recipient listed in its e-mail address database will successfully receive the e-mail message instituted with the blast e-mail procedures specified above.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 600 (Establishment of Website)
Websites Established by State Bar Entities (Adopted May 17, 2007)

No section, division, standing committee, special committee, program, department or other entity of the State Bar of Georgia may establish or maintain a website except as follows:

a mock up of the website, including both visuals and text, shall be submitted to the communications department and the bar counsel for written approval.
upon approval by both the communications department and bar counsel, the State Bar entity website may go online, but any material change to the website shall first be submitted for approval under subparagraph "a" above.
The Executive Committee, communications department, or bar counsel may rescind approval of any State Bar entity website at any time, with or without cause.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 700 (Use of Copyrighted Materials)

All requests for a license to use materials which are copyrighted by the State Bar shall be referred to the Executive Committee for approval pursuant to this policy.

Application: Any person seeking a license to use copyrighted material owned by the State Bar shall submit an application, directed to the Executive Committee, which contains the following information:
The name, address, and contact information (including phone number and email address) of the applicant. If the applicant is acting as an agent, such contact information for his or her principal shall also be provided;

Whether the material is intended for a single use, multiple uses, or continuing use by the applicant;

The Executive Committee, by majority vote, shall rule on the application and may attach such terms and conditions on the grant of the license as they deem necessary and desirable.
In determining whether to grant the requested license the Executive Committee should, among other considerations, determine that:
The use of the license will not reflect adversely on the State Bar of Georgia,
The use of the license will be in aid of and not hinder or be inconsistent with the purposes of the State Bar of Georgia as stated in Bar Rule 1-103,
The use of the license will be in aid of and not inconsistent with conduct that is germane to the legitimate purposes of the State Bar of Georgia, and
The purpose for which the license will be used will be of general interest and benefit to the members of the State Bar of Georgia.
No exclusive license shall be provided under this policy and licenses for multiple use or continuing use shall not exceed a term in excess of one year. The Executive Committee, at its sole discretion, may provide for automatic renewal of any license.
The Executive Committee, at its sole discretion and without cause, may terminate a license at any time by written notice to the grantee.
Standing Executive Committee Policy 800 (Fastcase Policy)
Fastcase Access Policy (Adopted Sept. 29, 2006, Revised May 23, 2013)

The Executive Committee, by unanimous voice vote, approved proposed Standing Executive Committee Policy 800 regarding Fastcase as follows:

Standing Executive Committee Policy 800 - Fastcase
All members of the State Bar of Georgia have access to Fastcase for online legal research. There is no user fee or other charge for this member benefit. Access is available at www.gabar.org in the Members Section with password required.

Other law-related entities, including Georgia accredited law schools and county law libraries, may also provide access under their own countracts with Fastcase.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 900 (Requests to Inspect State Bar Records)
Requests to Inspect Records of the State Bar of Georgia (Approved Oct. 7-8, 2005)
(Adopted as a Standing Executive Committee Policy Feb. 16, 2012)

While the Bar is not required by the "open records act" or any other legislation or rule to respond to requests to inspect records, it is its policy to respond to all reasonable requests from individual members of the State Bar in good standing to inspect State Bar records. By this policy the Bar does not waive any right it has to refuse any request for inspection, nor does it by this policy create any right of inspection.  However, before the State Bar will consider a request to inspect records, the member must be in good standing and must comply with the following:

The member must provide the State Bar with a written request to inspect records;
The written request must be sent to the attention of the Executive Director prior to the date on which the member wishes to inspect;
The member's request must be made in good faith and for a purpose that is reasonably relevant to the member's legitimate interest as a member;
The member must describe with reasonable particularity the records the member desires to inspect and the purpose of the inspection; and
The records must be directly connected with this purpose.
Should the member comply with the above-mentioned procedure, the Executive Director will consider the request, and provide a timely response.

When in the opinion of the Executive Director and General Counsel, a request calls for an inspection of records of a private, personal or confidential nature, or relates to a matter where an inquiry or investigation is pending, the inspection will not be allowed.

If the inspection is not allowed, the member may appeal this decision to the Executive Committee.

If the inspection is allowed, the following conditions shall apply:

The inspection shall be undertaken by the member in good standing requesting the inspection, and shall occur at such reasonable times and under such reasonable conditions and duration as may be determined by the State Bar;
The inspection shall occur at State Bar Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia;
The inspection shall occur in the presence of a State Bar staff member;
Because of confidentiality issues, no copying of State Bar records will be allowed; and
The State Bar may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of providing a staff member to locate and transport the records, to witness the inspection, and all other reasonable expenses. The requesting member shall pay in advance an estimate of the expenses, said estimate to be adjusted upon conclusion of the inspection by refund or additional payment.
Standing Executive Committee Policy 1000 (State Bar of Georgia Elections)
Active members of the State Bar of Georgia are encouraged to run for a number of important leadership positions, including officers (President-Elect, Secretary and Treasurer), Executive Committee at large members, Board of Governors members elected by judicial circuit and ABA delegates.

 As a supplement to the applicable Rules, Bylaws and other provisions listed below in paragraph (j), this policy is designed to:

1. Assist members who wish to offer as candidates with information about the election process;
2. Assist voters by providing to them a reasonable amount of information furnished by candidates in contested races; and
3. Afford all candidates a fair and equal election process.

(a) Election Schedule For All Leadership Positions. Pursuant to Article VII, Section 14, of the State Bar Bylaws, the Elections Committee will prepare an Election Schedule with appropriate time lines and dates for review and approval by the Board of Governors. 

(b) Campaigning For All Leadership Positions in Contested Races.

1. Professionalism. Candidates are encouraged to conduct positive campaigns and to refrain from sending negative, false or misleading information of any kind. 
2. State Bar Trademarks. The State Bar and YLD logos are registered trademarks of the State Bar of Georgia.  Any use of these trademarks without the prior written consent of the State Bar of Georgia is strictly prohibited.  All candidates for office with the State Bar and the YLD must refrain from incorporating these logos or any similar likeness, Bar letterhead, Bar images or any language that might imply an endorsement, into campaign materials.
3. State Bar Website. Pursuant to the approved Election Schedule ((a) above), the State Bar will provide each candidate a page on the State Bar website.  The candidate page will contain the candidate’s biography, candidate message, and photo, as described below. No hyperlinks will be allowed on the State Bar created page for candidates except as provided in 4.b below.  Each candidate’s information will remain on the State Bar website throughout the election.  Changes submitted after the deadline established for receipt of this information will not be accepted, and no date extensions for submitting the form will be granted for any reason.

a. Biography and Candidate Message Form. The Biography and Candidate Message Form affords an opportunity for candidates to further state qualifications and to better inform voters.  Candidates wishing to submit a Biography and Candidate Message Form must provide it in the electronic format supplied by the Bar.  Only the Biography and Candidate Message Form submitted via this method will be accepted.  Candidates will be advised how to obtain the electronic fillable form at the time they are notified of the contested race. The candidate also will be supplied with the deadline date for submission of the form at that time.  Forms received after the designated deadline date will not be published on the State Bar website.

There will be no additions, deletions or changes done to the electronic form by the candidate once the form is received by the State Bar.  The Elections Committee retains the right to decline to distribute any Biography or Candidate Message Form which is false, misleading, offensive or arguably illegal.

b. Photo. Each candidate may provide a headshot that will be included on the candidate page on the State Bar’s website.

4. State Bar E-mail.

a. Board of Governors Elections. The State Bar will distribute one e-mail per race per circuit to the eligible voters in the candidates’ circuit, which will contain the name of each candidate within that circuit with a link to his or her candidate page on the State Bar’s website.

b. Statewide Elections. The State Bar will distribute one e-mail per race to all eligible voters, which will contain the name of each candidate with a link to the candidate’s page on the State Bar’s website. In addition, each candidate in a contested statewide race may send 2 emails to all eligible voters.  The emails can be a letter of any length and may include hyperlinks if desired. The letters will be included in the body of the email and will be sent through the State Bar e-mail system following the guidelines in Standing Executive Committee Policy 500.

Candidates are free to send additional e-mails on their own, but e-mail addresses of voting members will not be provided as a list in electronic form or any other form by the State Bar, in accordance with Standing Executive Committee Policy 500.  Such campaign messages must state that the e-mail is coming directly from the candidate and not from the State Bar and that the recipient’s e-mail address was not provided in electronic or any other form to the candidate by the State Bar.  E-mail addresses for many State Bar members are publicly available through the printed and online directory at www.gabar.org.

All e-mails of this type must include the following language:

This e-mail is being sent directly by (Candidate) (or by ______ on behalf of and authorized by candidate) and not from the State Bar of Georgia.  E-mail addresses were not provided in electronic or any other form to the candidate by the State Bar of Georgia for this purpose.  E-mail addresses for many State Bar members are publicly available through the printed and online directory at www.gabar.org.

5. Mailing. A candidate may, upon request, receive one free set of printed or electronic mailing labels for the eligible voters in that candidate’s race for a single mailing in that year’s election only.  Additional sets may be purchased by contacting the State Bar’s Membership Department.  A nominal fee will be charged for additional sets.  Candidates will be provided with the most current number of active members in their circuit to budget accordingly.  A candidate may not copy the printed labels provided, or the information contained on them, and must delete the electronic file after the single use provided herein.  None of the information contained on the labels or in the file may be used at any other time or for any other purpose except as provided in this section.

(c) Board of Governors Nominating Petitions.  In accordance with the State Bar of Georgia Bylaws, Article VII, Sections 2 and 4, all candidates, including incumbents and non-incumbents, for circuit and out-of-state posts on the Board of Governors, are required to submit petitions of nomination.  Each candidate’s petition must be signed by a minimum number of active members of the State Bar from the circuit in which the candidate’s address as registered with the State Bar of Georgia under Rule 1-205 is located.  The minimum number of signatures varies by circuit size as follows:

1. three signatures from a circuit having less than twenty-five members;
2. seven signatures from a circuit having more than twenty-four but less than one hundred members; 
3. twenty signatures from a circuit having more than ninety-nine members; or
4. five active non-resident signatures for candidates for out-of-state posts.

In no case will nominating petition forms or other election materials be sent to a candidate prior to the date designated for such distribution on the approved election schedule.  The dated nominating petition form for a given election must be used.  Undated forms or dated forms from prior years may not be used.  Petitions on incorrect forms will be rejected and may be returned to the candidate.

Caution: Candidates are strongly encouraged to submit more than the required minimum number of signatures to compensate for any signatories who either are not active members or whose official address with the State Bar is not in the circuit of the candidate running for the Board of Governors post.  Early submission (approximately one week before deadline) is advised to allow the candidate time to obtain additional signatures, if necessary, before the deadline.  Failure to timely submit a petition with the required number of eligible signatures will result in that candidate’s exclusion from the ballot.

Regardless of the method of submission, all nominating petitions must be received at the Atlanta headquarters of the State Bar of Georgia no later than 11:59 p.m. on the appropriate deadline date, which is different for incumbent and non-incumbent candidates.  Candidates may submit nominating petitions via U.S. Postal Service, private sector delivery service, hand delivery, facsimile or e-mail.  Time receipt stamps on e-mails and facsimiles will determine if they were received prior to the deadline. Extensions of time may not be granted for any reason.  If original petitions are not submitted, then it is the responsibility of the candidate to maintain the original petition for thirty days past the date when results for that election are certified and announced.  Failure to provide the original petition at the request of the Elections Committee may result in the disqualification of the candidate, at the discretion of the Elections Committee.

The Election Schedule will establish the deadline date for nominating petitions to be submitted by incumbent candidates and a second deadline for petitions to be submitted by non-incumbent candidates.  If an incumbent’s valid petition is not received at the Atlanta headquarters of the State Bar of Georgia by 11:59 p.m. of the deadline date, that candidate will no longer be considered an incumbent.  He or she may run as a non-incumbent and submit the nominating petition by the date established on the approved Election Schedule for non-incumbent candidates.  In such a case, the incumbent will not be listed as an incumbent on the official election ballot.

If a non-incumbent’s valid petition is not received at the Atlanta headquarters of the State Bar of Georgia by 11:59 p.m. of the deadline date, that candidate will not be listed on the ballot, but may run as a write-in candidate.

(d) Board of Governors Circuit/Post Vacancies.  As soon as practicable after the deadline for receipt of incumbent nominating petitions has passed, a list of all expiring Board of Governors terms with the name of the incumbent if they have qualified will be e-mailed to all eligible voters in the Bar.  All Circuit/Posts with no candidate will be shown as having a vacancy.  In this email, there will also be detailed information instructing members on how to obtain a nominating petition, qualifications to become a candidate for a Board of Governors seat and appropriate election deadlines.  The same information will be included on the State Bar website.

Candidates may seek election to only one post within their circuit in a given election cycle, but may withdraw and re-qualify for a different post prior to the qualification deadline by submitting a new petition.  During the nomination period, the State Bar will disclose only the names of properly qualified candidates.  Other information, including the number or identities of members who have requested or filed petitions, or the names of signatories on petitions, will not be disclosed.

(e) Ballots.

1. Board of Governors Candidates.  Candidates will be listed on the ballot in alphabetical order by last name.  Candidates’ names will appear on the ballot as they appear in the Bar membership record.  If candidates wish to add a nickname, it will be noted in quotations, along with their official name. Candidates will indicate on their nominating petition forms if they wish to include a nickname on the ballot.  Incumbent candidates who submit their nominating petitions prior to the deadline for incumbents will be designated on the ballot with either the word “(Incumbent)” or “(I).” See item (c) Board of Governors Nominating Petitions.
2. Statewide Elections.  Candidates will be listed on the ballot in alphabetical order by last name under the heading of the office they are seeking. Candidates’ names will appear on the ballot as they appear in the Bar membership record.  If candidates wish to add a nickname, it will be noted in quotations, along with their official name.  Incumbent candidates will be designated on the ballot with either the word “(Incumbent)” or “(I).”
(f) Voting. Only those active members who were eligible to vote in a particular circuit at the time the ballot mailing file is transmitted to the printer will be eligible to vote in the election, even if their status changes during the period between the time the ballot mailing file is transmitted and the actual election begins.  Members will receive a ballot for the circuit they were in according to their official address at the time the ballot mailing file was transmitted, or if so elected under rule 1-205, the circuit in which the member resides.  Ballot changes will not be made due to the Bar having an incorrect address for the member (see Rule 1-207) once the mailing file is transmitted.

The Elections Committee or its designee will review write-in votes to reasonably assure that slight variations in the spelling of a write-in candidate’s name are identified with the same person.

(g) Declaration of Results.  After the Elections Committee Chair approves the release of election results, the President and Executive Director will be notified of the results and all candidates in contested races will be notified of the results in their races via e-mail or telephone.  Statewide candidates will be notified by the Chair of the Elections Committee or his/her designee.  Staff liaison will contact all other candidates.  Thereafter, the names of the winning candidates are public information and will be posted on the State Bar website no later than the date for election results release included in the election schedule.  They may be made available to any interested person.  Additional information including vote counts by circuit will be available to any member upon request.  This includes any election for any year for which records are available.  Out of respect for members who did not offer for election, but nevertheless did receive votes, write-in information is available only if deemed relevant by the Chair or Vice-Chair of the Elections Committee.

(h) Questions and Appeals.

1. Election Procedure.  The Elections Committee, or its Chair, Co-Chair or Vice-Chair, is the final authority on all election matters except election result contests.  Therefore, any decision by State Bar staff may be appealed in writing within three business days to the Executive Director.  The Elections Committee or its designee has the discretion to, but is not obligated to, grant a hearing with all interested parties invited in connection with any appeal.

2. Election Result Contests.  The Executive Committee of the State Bar is the final authority on all election contests, but any contest should first be made to the Elections Committee, which will seek to resolve the matter or make a recommendation to the Executive Committee.  Any person receiving one or more votes may file a written contest.  All contests shall be received by the Executive Director within ten business days after the result was released and shall specify the re-count or other relief requested.  The Executive Committee or its designee has the discretion, but is not obligated, to grant a hearing with all interested parties invited in connection with any appeal.

(i) Executive Committee Elected Positions

1. Notification Procedure. No later than 5 days after officer election results are posted and made available, an e-mail notice shall be provided to members of the Board of Governors of the Executive Committee positions to be elected pursuant to the Bylaws, Article IV, Section 1.
2. Campaigning. Members of the Board of Governors who are candidates for the Executive Committee of the State Bar are entitled to send 2 emails to all members of the Board of Governors.  The emails can be a letter of any length and may include hyperlinks, if desired.  The letters will be included in the body of the email and will be sent through the State Bar email system following the guidelines in Standing Executive Committee Policy 500.  In addition, each candidate is entitled to receive one free set of printed or electronic mailing labels which are to be used to inform the Board of their candidacy.  Additional sets may be purchased by contacting the State Bar’s Membership Department.  A nominal fee will be charged for additional sets.  A candidate may not copy the printed labels provided, or the information contained on them, and must delete the electronic file after the single use provided herein.  None of the information contained on the labels or in the file may be used at any other time or for any other purpose except as provided in this section.

Standing Executive Committee Policy 1100 (Member Legal Service Programs)
Consistent with the purpose of the State Bar of Georgia to foster among its members the principles of duty and service to the public, State Bar sections, divisions, committees, and programs (“State Bar Entities”) are encouraged to adopt, establish or participate in legal service programs and projects, including, but not limited to pro bono legal services through the Pro Bono Project or a 501(c)(3) legal services organization whose services conform to the American Bar Association Standards for Programs Providing Civil Pro Bono Legal Services to Persons of Limited Means. 

In an effort to provide qualified volunteers and to ensure that competent services are provided to the public, the State Bar expects the State Bar Entities to select legal service opportunities that provide their volunteers with adequate training and supervision, and require volunteers to maintain, or be covered by, legal malpractice insurance at all times when volunteering. All volunteers must comply with State Bar of Georgia rules and regulations and the rules and guidelines of the Pro Bono Project or other organizations through which the services are provided. 

Prior to adopting, creating, or participating in a legal service program or project, each State Bar Entity must seek advance approval of the Executive Director of the State Bar of Georgia.

Any YLD member may at any time submit a motion in writing to the President or Secretary, moving that an entity cease to be an Affiliate Unit.
